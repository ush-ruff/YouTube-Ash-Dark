Fixes for YouTube dark theme plus other custom enhancements to customize your YouTube experience. 

Options have been added to enable or disable each feature as the user chooses.


## Features
* Reduced contrast of font and icons in dark theme reduce eye strain
* Themed various elements to match the dark theme. Such as:
  * Searchbar suggestions dropdown.
  * Video end cards - channel, external links and recommended videos cards.
  * Info cards (i) menu - videos and other links included by the video creators.
  * Toast notifications.
* Changed likes and dislike indications to be more colorful.
* Added a flourish to reply input to give a better indication when it is selected.
* Other helpful customization options like:

  * Customize the thumbnail details on the homepage. Moves the channel logo to the second row alongside the channel name.
    >Only supported on firefox as the current implementation relies on subgrid

  * Hide player overlays, like the video title and player controls, while in fullscreen mode.
